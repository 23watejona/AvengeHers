## Inspiration
Our inspiration comes from our own personal experiences having to walk somewhere alone at night, often feeling unsafe or disconnected. Because we notice and face this problem regularly, we knew our product would help this issue in some way or another, and in a way that is accessible to everyone on a college campus.

## What it does
The app allows individuals to look at events that theyâ€™re going to and find other people who are walking there and back to create a group-walk, thus making the experience a safer and more fun one. Individuals can go to events, find the event they are planning on attending or making one if there is no entry for it, and then either add themselves to a group walk or create a new walk from a different starting location. The app is completely functional and easy to use.

## How we built it
We used HTML and JavaScript as our two primary languages. For JS, we used npm and node.js for our software library and runtime created our app with those tools. We split into two groups of two as two of us tackled front-end and the other two tackled back-end.

## Challenges we ran into
Because we all were working of a variety of different things all at once, multiple we times we ran into issues of people having differing code that then gets stuck in merge conflicts when we pushed our changes to GitHub. We spent a lot of time working through there merge conflicts and ensuring our progress wasn't getting deleted.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are incredibly proud of the final product. While we had a lot of goals and expectations in mind starting the project, we were able to focus and prioritize on what we specifically wanted to tackle during the duration of this project.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about working together on a full and complete web application. While many of us had experience in working on different parts of web appl development, we definitely struggled with merging the front-end work and back-end work together in a cohesive and effective way. We spent a lot of time on this, but we learned a lot from the process.

## What's next for AvengeHers Walkshare
In terms of our application, we are planning to implement a portion to our app where individuals can find other people walking similar routes as them even if there is no specific event happening. For example, if someone was out late studying, they could find someone who is walking back in a similar direction as them so they won't need to walk back alone late at night. Additionally, we also hope to eventually host the site on unique Raspberry PI's.
